## Challenge Overview
Using Python to further analzye Colorado's election audit results. 
### Purpose
The purpose of this challenge was to help Seth and Tom further explore the election audit results by creating and writing a code for the voter turnout for each county, the percentage of votes from each county out of the total count, and the county with the highest turnout. The purpose was also to practice writing data from a Python file to a text file for clearer and easier to understand results.
