# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given us the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of cotes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Resources 
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.6.1, Visual Studio Code, 1.62.2

## Summary 
The analysis of the election shows that:
- There were 369,711 votes cast in the election.
- The candidates were:
    - Charles Casper Stockham
    - Diana DeGette
    - Raymon Anthony Doane
- The candidate results were:
    - Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the vote and 85,213 number of votes.
    - Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes.
    - Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the vote and 11,606 number of votes.
- The winner of the elction was:
    - Candidate Diana DeGette, who recieved 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes.

## Challenge Overview
Using Python to further analzye Colorado's election audit results. 
### Purpose
The purpose of this challenge was to help Seth and Tom further explore the election audit results by creating and writing a code for the voter turnout for each county, the percentage of votes from each county out of the total count, and the county with the highest turnout. The purpose was also to practice writing data from a Python file to a text file for clearer and easier to understand results.

## Election-Audit Summary
This script could be used for any election, not just an election for the Colorado Board of Elections! If you wanted to use another csv file with similar data, you would just have to change line 9 in the script from the part with "election_results.csv" to whichever csv file you wanted to generate a code for. If you wanted the terminal to print out the election results differently, you would change the words under line 84 that are in between the "\n". You could even add more lines to print!
